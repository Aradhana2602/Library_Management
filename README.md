# 📚 Library Management System (C++)

Welcome! This is a simple **Command-Line Library Management System** built in **C++** using Object-Oriented Programming and CSV file handling. It lets you manage books — add, view, and issue them — with persistent storage so your data stays even after the program closes.

Perfect for practicing C++ fundamentals like OOP, file I/O, and data handling!

## ✨ Features

✔ Add new books with **ID, title, and author**  
✔ View all books and check availability  
✔ Issue books and automatically update their status  
✔ Store data persistently using a CSV file (`books.csv`)  
✔ Easy-to-use **CLI menu interface**

## 🧠 Motivation

This project started as a way to reinforce my understanding of C++ basics — especially working with **classes, file handling**, and **menus in console applications**. It’s also a great base to expand into a more advanced system with search, return feature, and student management!
